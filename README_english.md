# Droidspaces RootFS Automated Build

This project builds Linux RootFS archives for Droidspaces through GitHub Actions. The build system is based on Dockerfile templates and exposes common options for distribution selection, KDE desktop size, Chinese localization, input method support, Snapdragon GPU acceleration, audio forwarding, TMOE, Docker, development tools, and Wayland/Anland support.

The goal is to reduce the amount of manual setup required to run a desktop Linux container on Android. Fork the repository, choose the build options in GitHub Actions, wait for the Release artifact, then import the generated `.tar.xz` RootFS into Droidspaces.

## Supported Targets

| Build target | Base image | KDE modes | Wayland/Anland | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Debian-13-KDE` | `debian:trixie` | `min`, `conc`, `mobile`, `none` | Supported | Uses the Debian 13 Trixie repositories. |
| `Ubuntu-24-KDE` | `ubuntu:24.04` | `min`, `conc`, `none` | Not supported | Supports `nosnap`. |
| `Ubuntu-25-KDE` | `ubuntu:25.10` | `min`, `conc`, `none` | Not supported | Supports `nosnap`. |
| `Ubuntu-26-KDE` | `ubuntu:26.04` | `min`, `conc`, `mobile`, `none` | Supported | Supports `nosnap`; recommended for Anland KDE. |
| `Fedora-43-KDE` | `fedora:43` | `min`, `conc`, `mobile`, `none` | Supported | Some devices require hardware access to avoid flicker or crashes. |
| `Arch-KDE` | `ogarcia/archlinux` | `min`, `conc`, `none` | Not supported | Kernel 5.10 or newer is recommended; this project's QEMU/binfmt flow is not recommended for Arch at the moment. |

`all` builds every Dockerfile template. `all-wayland` builds only the Wayland-capable targets, currently `Debian-13-KDE`, `Ubuntu-26-KDE`, and `Fedora-43-KDE`, and forces Wayland support on.

## Feature Overview

- Multi-distribution RootFS builds for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch.
- Scalable KDE desktop profiles, from command-line only to minimal, compact, and mobile KDE.
- Termux:X11 desktop startup support. X11 mode defaults to `DISPLAY=:5`.
- PulseAudio forwarding through Unix socket, TCP, or disabled mode.
- Optional Chinese locale with `zh_CN.UTF-8` and `Asia/Shanghai` timezone.
- Optional Fcitx5 input method. Chinese input addons are installed when Chinese localization is enabled.
- Snapdragon GPU support using configuration from `mesa-for-android-container`.
- Container integration improvements for common Android/Droidspaces hardware, network, and group recognition.
- Optional TMOE integration. Run `tmoe` inside the container to start it.
- Optional development toolchain packages, including compilers, CMake, and Python development tooling.
- Optional compression utilities such as `zip`, `unzip`, `7z`, `xz`, `tar`, and `gzip`.
- Optional Docker packages inside the RootFS.
- Wayland/Anland support for Debian 13, Ubuntu 26.04, and Fedora 43 through patched KWin and Xwayland packages.
- Automatic Release publishing with the RootFS `.tar.xz` files and matching audio startup scripts.

## Build Options

The main GitHub Actions inputs are:

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution to build (`build_target`) | Distribution target, `all`, `all-wayland` | `Debian-13-KDE` | Selects which RootFS target to build. |
| Custom username (`custom_username`) | String | `Gold` | Default user inside the RootFS. The audio startup script in the Release is patched with this username. |
| KDE desktop choice (`build_KDE`) | `conc`, `min`, `mobile`, `none` | `min` | KDE desktop size. `none` builds a command-line only RootFS. |
| KDE desktop auto-start (`build_KDE_plus`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Creates a systemd service to auto-start KDE. Requires a KDE mode other than `none`; turn it off when building `none`. |
| Wayland support (`enable_anland_kde`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Enables Wayland/Anland support. Supported only on Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Fedora 43. |
| PulseAudio forwarding (`PulseAudio`) | `socket`, `tcp`, `none` | `socket` | Audio forwarding mode for X11 builds. It is forced to `none` when Anland is enabled. |
| Chinese language and timezone (`enable_zh_tz`) | `true`, `false` | `false` in the English workflow | Enables Chinese locale and the Shanghai timezone. |
| Qualcomm Snapdragon GPU support (`enable_mesa`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enables Qualcomm Snapdragon GPU and Mesa-related support. |
| Integrate TMOE (`enable_tmoe`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Integrates TMOE. |
| Remove Ubuntu Snap (`nosnap`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Ubuntu-only option that removes Snap, snapd, and APT policy paths that may reinstall snapd. |
| Fcitx5 input method support (`enable_srf`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Installs Fcitx5 input method support. |
| Cross-architecture support (`enable_binfmt`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Adds binfmt cross-architecture components inside the RootFS. Not recommended for Arch in this project. |
| NAT and hardware recognition (`enable_yj`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enables container hardware and network recognition improvements. |
| Development tools integration (`enable_kfgj`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Installs development tools. |
| Compression tools integration (`enable_zip`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Installs common compression tools. |
| Docker integration (`enable_docker`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Installs Docker-related packages inside the RootFS. |
| Build Wayland prebuilt packages (`build_wayland_packages`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Triggers the KWin/Xwayland prebuilt package workflow before building the RootFS. |

KDE mode details:

| Mode | Description | Recommended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | Does not install KDE. Keeps a command-line environment only. | Lightweight RootFS, SSH use, development environments, or custom desktop setups. |
| `min` | Minimal KDE desktop with Plasma basics and startup dependencies. | Smaller KDE builds that still provide a usable desktop. |
| `conc` | Compact but more complete KDE desktop with more system tools, monitoring, file management, and multimedia components. | General desktop use. |
| `mobile` | KDE Plasma Mobile components. | Phone-screen and touch-first usage; forces Wayland in this project. |

Audio mode details:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `socket` | Uses a Unix socket for PulseAudio forwarding. This is usually lower latency and is recommended for X11 mode. |
| `tcp` | Uses `127.0.0.1:4713` for PulseAudio forwarding. It is straightforward to debug, but exposes a wider interface. |
| `none` | Does not configure PulseAudio. Anland mode automatically uses this value because the Anland app provides its own audio path. |

## Build with GitHub Actions

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Open the `Actions` page in your fork.
3. Select the Chinese workflow `编译并发布 Droidspaces RootFS` or the English workflow `Build and Release Droidspaces RootFS`.
4. Click `Run workflow`.
5. Choose the distribution, KDE mode, username, and feature toggles.
6. For Wayland/Anland builds, choose `Ubuntu-26-KDE`, `Debian-13-KDE`, or `Fedora-43-KDE`, then enable `enable_anland_kde`.
7. If you want to rebuild the patched KWin/Xwayland packages before building the RootFS, enable `build_wayland_packages`.
8. Wait for the workflow to finish. Build time depends on the number of targets, KDE mode, and GitHub runner availability.
9. Open the `Releases` page and download the generated `.tar.xz` RootFS.

The Release usually contains:

- One or more RootFS archives
- RootFS filenames are marked by display mode as `X11`, `Wayland`, or `Mobile`, for example `Ubuntu-26-KDE-Mobile-Droidspaces-rootfs-aarch64-v20260702-120000.tar.xz`.
- `on_aaudio_socket.sh` or `on_aaudio_tcp.sh` when `PulseAudio` is set to `socket` or `tcp` and `build_KDE_plus=false`.
- A Release body that records the build target, KDE mode, Wayland setting, username, and feature toggles.

## Import into Droidspaces

1. Create or import a container in Droidspaces.
2. Select the `.tar.xz` RootFS downloaded from the Release.
3. If the RootFS includes KDE, enable GPU access in Droidspaces.
4. For Ubuntu and Debian, enabling `noseccomp` in privileged mode is strongly recommended. The kernel should also have `USER_NS` enabled. Without these, some desktop operations may freeze or lag noticeably.
5. For Fedora, some devices require hardware access. Without it, the desktop may flicker or crash.
6. For Arch, kernel 5.10 or newer is recommended.
7. For X11 mode, prepare Termux:X11.
8. For Wayland/Anland mode, complete the host-side Anland setup described below.

## Start KDE Desktop

### X11 Mode

X11 mode applies to builds where `enable_anland_kde` is disabled. The default display environment is:

```text
DISPLAY=:5
```

It is recommended to keep `build_KDE_plus=true`, which is now the default. With it enabled, the RootFS creates a KDE auto-start systemd service so the desktop can start after the container boots. Disable it only when you want to use the Termux-side `on_aaudio_*` script to start the desktop manually, or when building a `none` command-line environment.

If the Release includes an audio startup script, run it from Termux to start PulseAudio, Termux:X11, and KDE:

```bash
chmod +x on_aaudio_socket.sh
./on_aaudio_socket.sh
```

Or:

```bash
chmod +x on_aaudio_tcp.sh
./on_aaudio_tcp.sh
```

Before using the script, check the variables at the top:

```bash
CONTAINER_NAME="your Droidspaces container name"
USERNAME="your RootFS username"
DISPLAY_NUMBER=":5"
DPI=315
```

`USERNAME` is patched automatically during Release generation according to `custom_username`, but `CONTAINER_NAME` must still match the container name in Droidspaces.

If you do not use the helper script, enter the container and start KDE manually:

```bash
startplasma-x11
```

The actual auto-start behavior still depends on Droidspaces systemd support, permissions, and the configured display backend. If the desktop does not start automatically, enter the container and run `startplasma-x11` for debugging.

### Wayland/Anland Mode

Wayland/Anland mode applies to Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Fedora 43 builds where `enable_anland_kde` is enabled. The default environment includes:

```text
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0
DISPLAY=:0
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
ANLAND=1
ANLAND_SOCKET=/run/display.sock
ANLAND_DRM_DEVICE=/dev/dri/renderD128
```

After completing the host-side Anland setup, run this inside the container:

```bash
startplasma-wayland
```

## Wayland and Anland Setup

Wayland support depends on [anland](https://github.com/superturtlee/anland) and the patched KWin/Xwayland prebuilt packages stored in this repository. `Ubuntu-26-KDE` is recommended, while `Debian-13-KDE` and `Fedora-43-KDE` are also supported.

Recommended build options:

| Option | Recommended value |
| --- | --- |
| `build_target` | `Ubuntu-26-KDE` |
| `build_KDE` | `min`, `conc`, or `mobile` |
| `build_KDE_plus` | `true` |
| `enable_anland_kde` | `true` |
| `PulseAudio` | No manual setting required; it becomes `none` when Anland is enabled |

Host-side setup:

1. Download `virtual-drm-daemon.zip` from [anland Releases](https://github.com/superturtlee/anland/releases), flash it, and reboot the device.
2. Download and install `app-debug.apk` from the same Release.
3. Enable hardware access when importing the Droidspaces container.
4. Enable SELinux permissive mode, or use the precise SELinux policy fix documented below.
5. Enable `nocaps` and `noseccomp` in privileged mode.
6. Add this bind mount in advanced options:

```text
/data/local/tmp/display_daemon.sock -> /run/display.sock
```

7. Start the container and log in as the normal user.
8. Run:

```bash
startplasma-wayland
```

If `mobile` is selected, the workflow forces Wayland on because Plasma Mobile is configured through the Wayland path in this project.

## DRI3 and SELinux Fixes

If you see `DRI3` errors while starting the graphical environment, SELinux is likely blocking file descriptor passing between Droidspaces and the graphics backend. Choose one of the following fixes.

### Option 1: Patch SELinux Policy Precisely

With KernelSU, run this in the Android host root shell:

```bash
/data/adb/ksud sepolicy patch "allow untrusted_app_27 droidspacesd fd use"
```

This is the recommended option because it has a smaller scope.

### Option 2: Make the Whole `untrusted_app_27` Domain Permissive

First check which apps belong to targetSdk 26 through 28:

```bash
/system/bin/dumpsys package packages | /system/bin/awk '/^ *Package \[/ {pkg=$2} /targetSdk=(26|27|28)$/ {print "App: " pkg " -> " $1}'
```

If the risk is acceptable, run:

```bash
/data/adb/ksud sepolicy patch "permissive untrusted_app_27"
```

This has a broader impact and is better treated as a temporary debugging step unless you fully understand the security tradeoff.

### Option 3: Use a Permissive Kernel

Switch the device SELinux state to Permissive. This is simple, but weakens the security boundary the most.

### Option 4: Modify the Droidspaces Module Policy File

Edit this host-side file:

```text
/data/adb/modules/droidspaces/etc/droidspaces.te
```

Find:

```text
# Termux related
# Only uncomment the line below if you encounter any problems about DRI3
# allow untrusted_app_27 droidspacesd fd use
```

Uncomment the last line:

```text
allow untrusted_app_27 droidspacesd fd use
```

Save the file and reboot the device.

## Account, Password, and Username Changes

Default account settings:

| Item | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Username | `Gold`, configurable through the workflow `custom_username` input |
| Password | `1234` |
| Shell | `/bin/bash` |

Change the password after importing:

```bash
passwd
```

To rename the user after building, run the following as root. This example renames `Gold` to `NewUser`:

```bash
usermod -l NewUser Gold
usermod -d /home/NewUser -m NewUser
groupmod -n NewUser Gold
passwd NewUser
```

## Local Build

This project is designed primarily for GitHub Actions, but local Docker Buildx builds are supported. Requirements:

- Docker
- Docker Buildx
- `xz`
- A working QEMU/binfmt setup if cross-architecture builds are required

Native build example:

```bash
chmod +x build_rootfs-native.sh
./build_rootfs-native.sh \
  -i Debian-13-KDE.Dockerfile \
  -v local \
  -K min \
  -L true \
  -P socket \
  -g true \
  -a false \
  -b true \
  -c true \
  -d false \
  -e true \
  -f false \
  -h false \
  -j true \
  -n false \
  -u Gold \
  -A false
```

QEMU arm64 build example:

```bash
chmod +x build_rootfs-qemu-aarch64.sh
./build_rootfs-qemu-aarch64.sh \
  -i Ubuntu-26-KDE.Dockerfile \
  -v local \
  -K conc \
  -L true \
  -P none \
  -g true \
  -a false \
  -b true \
  -c true \
  -d false \
  -e true \
  -f false \
  -h true \
  -j true \
  -n true \
  -u Gold \
  -A true
```

After a successful build, the output file will look similar to:

```text
Ubuntu-26-KDE-Wayland-Droidspaces-rootfs-aarch64-local.tar.xz
```

`anland-build/` stores patched KWin and Xwayland prebuilt packages. `build-kde-wayland.yml` can rebuild those packages and commit the updates back to the repository. The current Chinese RootFS workflow filename contains a leading space: `.github/workflows/ build-rootfs-releases.yml`.

## Known Limitations

- Wayland/Anland support currently covers only Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Fedora 43.
- Ubuntu 24, Ubuntu 25, and Arch currently use the X11 path.
- `mobile` mode is allowed only on Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Fedora 43.
- When Anland is enabled, the workflow disables PulseAudio forwarding because the Anland app provides its own audio path.
- Fedora may require hardware access on some devices to avoid flicker or crashes.
- Ubuntu and Debian may lag or freeze if `noseccomp` is disabled or the kernel lacks `USER_NS`.
- The default password is `1234`; change it after importing the RootFS.
- Compatibility between the bundled prebuilt Wayland packages and upstream anland depends on the upstream state at build time.
